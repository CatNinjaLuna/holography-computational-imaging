# Phase 1 — Physics & Simulation

This phase establishes the **physical foundations** of holography by explicitly modeling wave propagation and hologram formation.

No learning is used in this phase.

---

## Objectives

-  Understand holography as a wave-interference phenomenon
-  Implement Fresnel diffraction numerically
-  Generate synthetic holograms with known ground truth
-  Validate numerical propagation against analytical solutions

---

## Key Concepts

-  Complex optical fields (amplitude + phase)
-  Fresnel diffraction integral
-  Sampling conditions and propagation distance
-  Inline holography geometry

---

## Contents

Typical components in this phase include:

-  Fresnel propagation (FFT-based)
-  Hologram intensity formation
-  Back-propagation
-  Phase visualization

---

## Validation

Validation is critical in this phase:

-  Compare numerical propagation with analytical Fresnel kernels
-  Verify energy conservation
-  Confirm phase consistency under forward/back propagation

This phase serves as the **ground truth generator** for later phases.
