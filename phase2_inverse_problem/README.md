# Phase 2 — Inverse Problem Formulation

This phase treats holographic phase recovery as a **classical inverse problem**.

The focus is on understanding:

-  What information is missing
-  What constraints are required
-  How different solvers behave under non-ideal conditions

---

## Objectives

-  Perform phase recovery from intensity-only measurements
-  Study robustness to noise, defocus, and missing data
-  Compare classical phase retrieval algorithms

---

## Methods Explored

-  Gerchberg–Saxton (GS)
-  Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE)
-  Optimization-based phase retrieval
-  Regularization and constraints

---

## Perturbations Studied

-  Additive noise
-  Axial defocus
-  Reduced measurement diversity
-  Model mismatch

---

## Evaluation Criteria

-  Reconstruction accuracy
-  Convergence behavior
-  Sensitivity to noise
-  Failure modes

This phase provides a **baseline and diagnostic tool** for learning-based approaches.
