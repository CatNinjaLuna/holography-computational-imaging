# Phase 4 — Applications

This phase applies reconstructed phase information to **downstream perception tasks**.

The emphasis is on **physical interpretability and usefulness**, not just visual quality.

---

## Objectives

-  Convert phase into depth or 3D structure
-  Generate depth maps or point clouds
-  Explore application-driven evaluation

---

## Application Directions

-  3D scene reconstruction
-  Depth estimation from holography
-  Volumetric imaging
-  Comparison with stereo or LiDAR

---

## Target Domains

-  Robotics perception
-  Microscopy and biomedical imaging
-  Computational 3D sensing

---

## Evaluation

-  Geometric accuracy
-  Depth consistency
-  Robustness to artifacts
-  Applicability to real-world sensing

This phase demonstrates how **holography transitions from imaging to perception**.
